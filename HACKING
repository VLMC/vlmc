Hacking on VLMC
---------------

Thanks
------
Most parts of this guide are taken from the Amarok coding rules.

This C++ FAQ is a life saver in many situations, so you want to keep it handy:

Formatting
----------
* Spaces, not tabs
* Indentation is 4 spaces
* No trailing spaces
* Lines should be limited to 90 characters
* Spaces between brackets and argument functions
* Spaces before and after operators
* For pointer and reference variable declarations put a space between the type
  and the * or & and no space before the variable name.
* For if, else, while and similar statements put the brackets on the next line,
  although brackets are not needed for single statements.
* Function and class definitions have their brackets on separate lines
* A function implementation's return type is on its own line.
* A return keyword must be used without parenthesis.
* CamelCase.{cpp,h} style file names.
* Qt 4 includes a foreach keyword which makes it very easy to iterate over all
  elements of a container.

Example:

 | bool
 | MyClass::myMethod( QStringList list, const QString &name )
 | {
 |     if( list.isEmpty() )
 |         return false;
 |
 |     /*
 |       Define the temporary variable like this to restrict its scope
 |       when you do not need it outside the loop. Let the compiler
 |       optimise it.
 |     */
 |     foreach( const QString &string, list )
 |         debug() << "Current string is " << string;
 | }


The program astyle can be used to automatically format source code, which can
be useful for badly formatted 3rd party patches.

Use it like this to get (approximately) VLMC formatting style:

    "astyle -s4 -b -p -U -D -o source.cpp"


Class, Function, Enums & Variable Naming
---------------------------------
* Use CamelCase for everything.
* Local variables should start out with a lowercase letter.
* Class names are capitalized
* Prefix class member variables with m_, ex. m_tracksView.
* Prefix static member variables with s_, ex s_instance
* Functions are named in the Qt style. It's like Java's, without the "get"
  prefix.
  * A getter is variable()
  * If it's a getter for a boolean, prefix with 'is', so isCondition()
  * A setter is setVariable( arg ).


Best Practices
--------------
* Focus on code portability
* Focus on code readability
  * Do not overload an operator without a valid justification
  * For each overloaded operator, there must be an equivalent method
  * Do not use reinterpret_cast without a valid justification
  * Do not write functions and/or methods of more than 100 lines


Includes
--------
Header includes should be listed in the following order:
    - Own Header
    - VLMC includes
    - Qt includes

They should also be sorted alphabetically, for ease of locating them. A small
comment if applicable is also helpful.

Includes in a header file should be kept to the absolute minimum, as to keep
compile times low. This can be achieved by using "forward declarations"
instead of includes, like "class QListView;". Forward declarations work for
pointers and const references.

In vim you can sort headers automatically by marking the block, and then
doing ":sort".

Example:

 | #include "MySuperWidget.h"
 |
 | #include "Timeline.h"
 | #include "TracksRuler.h"
 | #include "TracksView.h"
 |
 | #include <QGraphicsView>
 | #include <QWidget>


Comments
--------
Comment your code. Don't comment what the code does, comment on the purpose of
the code. It's good for others reading your code, and ultimately it's good for
you too. Every method must be commented (in Doxygen format), including
potential return value and potential parameters.

For headers, use the Doxygen syntax. See: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/


Header Formatting
-----------------
General rules apply here. Please keep header function definitions aligned
nicely, if possible. It helps greatly when looking through the code. Sorted
methods, either by name or by their function (ie, group all related methods
together) is great too. Access levels should be sorted in this order:
public, protected, private.

Example:

 | #ifndef TRACKSCONTROLS_H
 | #define TRACKSCONTROLS_H
 |
 | class TracksControls : public QScrollArea
 | {
 |     Q_OBJECT
 |
 |     public:
 |         TracksControls( QWidget *parent = 0 );
 |         ~TracksControls() {};
 |
 |     public slots:
 |         void            addVideoTrack( GraphicsTrack *track );
 |         void            addAudioTrack( GraphicsTrack *track );
 |         void            clear();
 |
 |     private:
 |         QWidget         *m_centralWidget;
 |         QWidget         *m_separator;
 |         QVBoxLayout     *m_layout;
 | };
 |
 | #endif // TRACKSCONTROLS_H


0 vs NULL
---------
0 and NULL are the same in C++. However, NULL is expected to be used with
pointers, therefore, it improves code clarity.
To summarize:
 * You shall use NULL when dealing with pointers.
 * You must not use NULL when dealing with something that's not a pointer.


Const Correctness
-----------------
Try to keep your code const correct. Declare methods const if they don't mutate
the object, and use const variables. It improves safety, and also makes it
easier to understand the code.

In case of a pointer/reference to a const value, you must put the const at the
beginning of the line.

See: http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/const-correctness.html

Example:

 | bool
 | MyClass::isValidFile( const QString &path ) const
 | {
 |     const bool valid = QFile::exist( path );
 |
 |     return valid;
 | }


Casts
-----
Prefer C++ casts instead of the traditionnals C casts.

Wrong:
 | void
 | MyClass::clicked( QAbstractButton *button )
 | {
 |     QPushButton *pButton = (QPushButton*)button;
 |
 |     pButton->setFlat( true );
 | }

Correct:
 | void
 | MyClass::clicked( QAbstractButton *button )
 | {
 |     QPushButton *pButton = static_cast<QPushButton *>( button );
 |
 |     pButton->setFlat( true );
 | }


Commenting Out Code
-------------------
Don't keep commented out code. It just causes confusion and makes the source
harder to read. Remember, the last revision before your change is always
availabe in Git. Hence no need for leaving cruft in the source.

Wrong:
 | myWidget->show();
 | //myWidget->rise(); //what is this good for?

Correct:
 | myWidget->show();


Internationalization (i18n)
---------------------------
Each translatable string should be enclosed within a tr().

Wrong:
 | myPushButton->setText( "Click me!" );

Correct:
 | myPushButton->setText( tr( "Click me!" ) );

Read more on: http://doc.trolltech.com/i18n-source-translation.html

VLMC also supports retranslation of the entire GUI at runtime. You should
subscribe to QEvent::LanguageChange to be notified of a language change and
update the GUI accordingly.

Example:

 | void
 | MyWidget::changeEvent( QEvent *e )
 | {
 |     QFrame::changeEvent( e );
 |     switch( e->type() )
 |     {
 |     case QEvent::LanguageChange:
 |         ui.retranslateUi( this );
 |         break;
 |     default:
 |         break;
 |     }
 | }


Embedding UI Class
------------------
Use simple aggregation to embed a Qt UI into your class.

Example:

 | #include "ui_MyWidget.h"
 |
 | class MyWidget : public QFrame
 | {
 |     Q_OBJECT
 |
 |     public:
 |         MyWidget( QWidget *parent = 0 );
 |         ~MyWidget() {};
 |
 |     protected:
 |         virtual void changeEvent( QEvent *e );
 |
 |     private:
 |         Ui::MyWidget ui;
 | };


Debugging
---------
Debug is not printed out on the console by default. However, everything is
written to a log file. This can be changed by setting -v, -vv, and
--logfile=[output_file]

Don't ever ever ever let some debugs such as "i am here", "ptr == 0xDEADB33F".
Just let what's required. (ie: a media loaded, the render has started.... )


Copyright
---------
To comply with the GPL, add your name, email address & the year to the top of
any file that you edit. If you bring in code or files from elsewhere, make sure
its GPL-compatible and to put the authors name, email & copyright year to the
top of those files.

Please note that it is not sufficient to write a pointer to the license (like a
URL). The complete license header needs to be written everytime.

Thanks, now have fun!
